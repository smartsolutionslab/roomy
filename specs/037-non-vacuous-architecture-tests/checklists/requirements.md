# Specification Quality Checklist: Architecture Tests Genuinely Inspect Every Roomy Assembly

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The "user" of this feature is the developer/agent relying on the quality gates; the
  spec is necessarily about the test harness itself. Assembly and project names are
  domain vocabulary here, not implementation leakage — the feature *is* the gate.
- NetArchTest/discovery mechanics are named only in the Input/Problem sections for
  traceability to issue #226; requirements are stated in terms of observable gate
  behavior.
